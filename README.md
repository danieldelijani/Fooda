# Fooda

Fooda is an app developed with React Native for Android and iPhone that helps you save money on groceries. It allows you to create a grocery list and compare the relative prices of your grocery list at nearby grocery stores.

For a demo of the application, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iMsdjlwTZY).
